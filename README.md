# Codecademy Project: Recommendation Software

## Overview (from Codecademy)
In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic recommendation program for a topic of your choice that has the following functionality:

- By entering letters or words into the terminal, the program will suggest a specific category for the user to explore. 
- If the user is interested in the category, the program will provide a variety of related recommendations to the user. 

After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice.

## Technical requirements
This project consists of two main parts:

1. Implementing an autocomplete that, based on a userâ€™s input, returns a list of possible categories based on the beginning of a word.
2. Retrieving and displaying all of the data related to the category selected by the user.

The program should also use at least one of these data structures: Linked List, Hash Map, Tree.

## Think of an idea
I'm going to build a recommendation program that helps users find music they might want to listen to.

## Project brainstorming
A first-pass guess at the functionality is:

1. Show a welcome message to the user
2. Ask the user to enter the beginning letter(s) of a music category. For example, if they just enter "r", they'll be shown a list of categories to choose from that start with "r", such as rock and reggae.
3. Show the options as a numbered list and ask the user to choose an option, or zero to try again.
4. Once the user chooses a music category, they'll be shown a list of popular (fictional) albums from that category.
5. To improve the user experience, the program will include input validation and easy ways to choose other categories or quit.

## Autocomplete
- This turned out to be a one-liner using "search_string in string" and a list comprehension.
- I needed to create a database of music categories and imaginary albums, so I asked GitHub Copilot and Microsoft Copilot, and between then they generated the appropriate content and Python lists.

## Category retrieval
