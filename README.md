# Codecademy Project: Recommendation Software

## Overview (from Codecademy)
In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic recommendation program for a topic of your choice. 

By entering letters or words into the terminal, the program will suggest a specific category for the user to explore. If the user is interested in the category, the program will provide a variety of related recommendations to the user. 

After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice.

## Music recommendation engine
I'm going to build a recommendation program that helps users find music they might want to listen to.

A first-pass guess at the functionality is:

1. Show a welcome message to the user
2. Ask the user to enter the beginning letter(s) of a music category. For example, if they just enter "r", they'll be shown a list of categories to choose from that start with "r", such as rock and reggae.
3. Show the options as a numbered list and ask the user to choose an option, or zero to try again.
4. Once the user chooses a music category, they'll be shown a list of (fictional) artists and albums.
5. This will include input validation loops and other things to improve the user experience.
